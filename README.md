## Pacifist

### Background

Pacifist is 2D game inspired by Geometry Wars - Pacifism mode. The objective in Geometry Wars is to survive as long as possible and score as many points as possible by destroying enemy ships.

Pacifism mode is played on a rectangular field, where the player controls a ship and its movements using the mouse as input. However unlike the other modes, the player's ship does not have a cannon equipped to destroy enemy ships. Instead the player must navigate through "Gates" in order set off an explosion to destroy enemies. When a player passes through a Gate any enemies within a certain radius of the Gate will be destroyed. Enemies spawn in groups around the four corners of the field. As the player progresses, the amount of enemies spawned will increase, until the player loses. A player will lose if an enemy ship touches their ship.
